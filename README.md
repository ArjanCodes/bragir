```

**Verifyting the installation**

# Usage

Bragir comes with two commands, transcribe and translate. Transcribe will always generate an file with extension `.srt`. The translate command has only been tested with SRT-files, however other files would work. However, Bragir is not intended to translate other file types  

In order to use either command, a Openai needs to be loaded into the terminal session or as an flag to the command.

Load Openai key as an enviroment variable into current session
```
export OPENAI_KEY=<VALUE>
```

Or, api_key flag in command:
```
bragir translate ... --api_key <VALUE>
```

### Examples
Translate a single file to one language:

```
bragir translate <FILE_PATH> --language French --api_key <VALUE>
```

Translate one file to multiple languages:

```
bragir translate <FILE_PATH> --language French --language German --api_key <VALUE>
```

Translate files in a directory to multiple languages:

```
bragir translate <DIRECTORY_PATH> --language French --language German --api_key <VALUE>
```

Transcribe file:

```
bragir transcribe <FILE_PATH> --api_key <VALUE>
```

Transcribe files in a directory:

```
bragir transcribe <DIRECTORY_PATH> --api_key <VALUE>
```
